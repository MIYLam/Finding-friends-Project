Might be maintained, maybe not

Post production thoughts and reflections:
This is one of the worst projects that I have ever undertaken. Learnt a lot about realistic goal setting and general productivity methods, especially time management.  
So many regrets after the due date, but it is what it is. 
The most important thing I learnt, ironically, was how powerful classes were, and now I really have expanded my understanding of OOP. 
My coding ability has 100% improved way more, and considering I had no idea what I was doing 15 months ago, I'm proud of how far I have come in terms of coding.
